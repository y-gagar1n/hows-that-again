# How's that again?

This is a source code for https://y-gagar1n.github.io/hows-that-again/. 

It is just a dump of all my personal cheatsheets about various utilities and technologies that I keep forgetting and have to google them again and again. Made just for personal usage, but may be useful to someone someday (which is unlikely 'cause it's all in russian).

Build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

## Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
gatsby develop
```

## Deploy
```sh
npm run deploy
```
